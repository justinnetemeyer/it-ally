                <h2>Application Engineering Capabilities</h2>
                <p>Whether joining a project at its inception or later in its life-cycle--as the project lead or in a supporting role-- our developers quickly assess system requirements and provide innovative design, coding, and integration capabilities owning to our experience spanning a wide variety of databases, programming languages, and operating systems. We have over 20 years of expertise in creating software applications which enforce strict business rules and workflow while remaining compliant with customer security requirements, such as those delineated by Fleet Cyber Command.. Our personnel are skilled, diligent, and trust-worthy, maintaining both DoD SECRET clearances and high-level accesses to DoD data centers.</p>

                <h2>Innovation</h2>
                <p>Our software teams constantly explore ways to utilize or integrate Commercial off -the-Shelf (COTS) and Open Source technologies within our own solutions to offer better, faster, and more cost-effective applications while still meeting our customersâ€™ performance, timeline, security, and cost requirements. For our DoD customers, we frequently analyze deployed government-owned systems which may be easily modified and utilized by other government entities, thus avoiding costly and unnecessary development expenditures as well as hosting fees.</p>

                <h2>Project Management</h2>
                <p>Our employees are PMP certified and support IT projects for individual program executive offices (PEOs) as well as the NAVSEA front office. We understand that when dealing with a myriad of IT terms from multiple contractors (big and small), it is comforting to have an ally beside you, asking the technical questions that will assist in delivering a product on budget and on time.</p>
